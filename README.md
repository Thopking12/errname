## Overview

Welcome to **Errname**, the Golang linter designed to ensure that your sentinel errors follow best practices. This tool checks that sentinel errors are prefixed with `Err` and that error types are suffixed with `Error` or `Errors`. By adhering to these conventions, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
